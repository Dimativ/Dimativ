I'm a highly motivated Front-End Developer, I have a practice how to create user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. My goal is to develop world-changing products that make a difference and build my version of the digital world gradually. I am always eager to learn and master new technologies, and I excel both independently and as a part of a team.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I was born in small village Lvove, Ukraine. When I was 9 mounth, my family migrate to Dnipro, Ukraine. Later I went to primary school, and started studying at math class.

The next step in my life was studying at gymnasium, in which, for my academic performance, I was awarded a diploma for excelling in computer science.

Having passed the exams, I obtained a place at the Dnipro technical university. At university, I am studying Computer engineering. I consider myself very responsible and curiousness towards the knowledge that is displayed in my grades.

In May 2022, I made a desicion try my skills at work. This one, albeit small, but the work experience gave me an impetus to development and I understand what I want to do in the near future. During this period, experience was gained with: React, Rest API, Figma and the most popular libraries for React.

Now I am learning React and developing my own pet projects. 

I have also always been into sports. I played football semi-professionally. Now I do physical exercise at the gym. All these activities have always helped me to stay mentally healthy and insatiable for my work.

In conclusion, I want to say about my life principle - "Do with passion !"
